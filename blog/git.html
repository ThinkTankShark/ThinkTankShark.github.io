        <p><font color="blue">1. What are the benefits of version control?</font> There are many benefits of using a version control system (<font color="red">VCS</font>) such as <li>Collaboration: Without VCS you and/or team of programmers are working on a set files all together in a same file! [Scary]</li><li>Storing: It will let you to get to a habit of storing your code consistently in a proper manner.</li><li>Restoring: In case you have done some unneccsary changes, you can always go back and redo.</li><li>Documentaion: Everytime you commit to changes you have to add a note on what is changing</li>
        </p>
        <p><font color="blue">2. How does git help you keep track of changes?</font> Git will use a "HEAD" index to point to your files inside a place created by user which called repository. These are the possible stages in any repository:<li><font color="green"><u>Untracked:</u></font> This is where a file in a repository is modified but not yet added to git to track changes. Run Command "Git add 'Name_Of_The_File'"</li><li><font color="blue"><u>Unmodified:</u></font> This is where the file has in tracking stage and has not yet been changed by user</li><li><font color="purple"><u>Modified:</u></font> This is where the file is in tracking stage and has been modified and is ready to commit</li><li><font color="red"><u>Staged:</u></font> This is where the file is added to stage </li></p>

        </p>

        <p><font color="blue">3. Why use GitHub to store your code?</font> In general using git will be stored locally on your computer so in case of data corruption, everythig WOULD BE GONE! Using Github will store your data remotely, in my opinion these are the advantages of using Github: <li>Having more flexibility over Git</li><li>You can share your data with the world or keep private</li><li>Stable Cloud</li><li>Although not recommended but you can use the app for easier UI</li>
