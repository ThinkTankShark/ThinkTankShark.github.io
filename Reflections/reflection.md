1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
    - At first I was having a hard time making things centered or working with their position, specially 'absolute' or 'fixed'. After hours of working and researching I found a way to fix this. It's a great practice to always put relative items inside a container (section or nav or div) and then work on padding, marging or border on that container.
    - This is a grea practice when you are trying to center things with out using <center> in html.

2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?
    - I worked with fixed multiple times. for instance by using position fixed I was able to fix my header tab so when scroll down or up it would move as well.

3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
    -easy: I think working with tables was the easiest for me.
    - difficult: how to position items, padding and margin was a bit challenging. Btw I found out Chrome DevTools section very useful for this concept.
4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
    - After I validated my html part throught html5 validation, I found out a lot of items such <center> and etc.. needs to be removed, so at first it was hard for me to figure out how to center things till I found about the text align attribute.
